# Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset - Digit Recognition

Recognizing objects in natural scenes, such as house numbers, using deep learning techniques is one of the most interesting tasks in the field. Machine learning algorithms can process visual information and provide valuable insights and applications.

The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is widely used in image recognition tasks and has been leveraged by Google to enhance map quality. By automatically transcribing address numbers from pixels, the dataset aids in pinpointing the locations of buildings.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to predict the numbers depicted in the images from the SVHN dataset. We will explore the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task. Multiple models of each type will be implemented and evaluated to determine the one that offers the best performance.

## Dataset

The SVHN dataset consists of labeled images, where each image contains a cropped digit. The dataset provides both training and testing data, allowing for the development and evaluation of our models. Preprocessing steps, such as resizing and normalization, will be applied to the images to prepare them for training.

## Methodology

1. Data preprocessing: Resize and normalize the images from the SVHN dataset to a suitable format for model training.

2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach: Implement a fully connected feed-forward neural network model. Train the model using the training dataset and optimize its parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent.

3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach: Implement a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Train the model on the training dataset using backpropagation and optimize its performance.

4. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained ANN and CNN models using the testing dataset. Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to assess the models' effectiveness in digit recognition.

5. Model comparison and selection: Compare the performance of the different ANN and CNN models and select the one that achieves the highest accuracy and best meets the project's requirements.

## Results

The results of the model evaluation phase will be presented, including accuracy, precision, recall, and any other relevant metrics. Visualizations of the model's predictions and performance will also be provided.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored the task of digit recognition in natural scenes using the SVHN dataset. By applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we developed models capable of accurately predicting the numbers depicted in the images. The selected model demonstrated superior performance based on evaluation metrics.

This project showcases the potential of deep learning algorithms in image recognition tasks and offers insights into the application of ANNs and CNNs for digit recognition. The developed models can find applications in address transcription, map quality improvement, and other related fields.

## Future Work

- Explore techniques to enhance the models' performance, such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or ensemble methods.
